      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking Questions Is Critical for Troubleshooting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still recall a troubleshooting case from roughly five years agoâ€”one that stuck with me because it taught me just how targeted questions can be. Back then, I spent weeks tied up in a frustrating problem for a customer, and the resolution ended up being simpler than I&amp;rsquo;d ever guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue centered on their Microsoft Dynamics AX2012 system: when they finalized a purchase order for the first time, everything ran smoothly. But if they tried to finalize a second order right after, the system would freeze for about three minutes. Worse yet, that freeze wasn&amp;rsquo;t just isolated to the purchase order functionâ€”no one at the company could use AX at all during that time. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t even open a new AX client; the entire system ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
